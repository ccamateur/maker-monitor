# Maker Monitor

This project aims to make useful Maker and Dai system metrics easily available through open source monitoring tools.
I have chosen to use Prometheus as the backend for simplicity, and Grafana for the frontend for flexibility.

## Developing

### Installing Dependancies

Just run it! We're using Go modules :D 

### Building the Monitor binary

```
./monitor/scripts/build.sh
```

*Note:* The binary build script builds for the `golang:alpine` Docker container. Use `go build` or `go run` for local.

## To Do

- CÐ¾nfigure k8s for local development
- Add Grafana (of course!)
- Configure CI to build and publish image to Docker Hub automatically

## Deployment

To deploy Maker Monitor you'll need to create a series of config maps, pods and services via Kuberenetes. The following
set of commands assumes you've aliased `kubectl` as `k`.

```bash
# This is secrect, and isn't shared in the repo, which is why you need to create it yourself
k create configmap monitor-config --from-literal=INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<your infura project ID>

# Deploy the monitor service
k apply -f monitor/k8s/pod.yml
k apply -f monitor/k8s/service.yml

# Deploy the prometheus service
k create configmap prometheus-config --from-file=prometheus/prometheus.yml
k apply -f prometheus/k8s/pod.yml
```

If you didn't run into any errors you should be able to connect to Prometheus via

```bash
k port-forward prometheus-pod 9090:9090
```
