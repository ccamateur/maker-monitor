# Maker Monitor

This project aims to make useful Maker and Dai system metrics easily available through open source monitoring tools.
I have chosen to use Prometheus as the backend for simplicity, and Grafana for the frontend for flexibility.

## To Do

- Add Grafana (of course!)

- Introduce Go modules to deprecate the use of a simple install script

- Update Go Dockerfile to use multistage builds
